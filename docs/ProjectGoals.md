"# Project Goals for Gocart E-commerce Microservices API

## Overview
This project aims to build a microservice-based e-commerce API system using Go. The core components include Product Service, User Service, and Order Service. Key technical requirements involve microservice architecture, PostgreSQL database integration, Redis caching, Docker deployment, comprehensive testing, API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger, logging, monitoring, and rate limiting.

## Implemented Features
- **Product Service**: Full CRUD operations for products (list, create, get, update, delete) with GORM-based repository, HTTP handlers using Gorilla Mux, OpenAPI documentation, unit and integration tests.
- **User Service**: Full CRUD operations for users (create, get, update, delete, list) with GORM repository, HTTP handlers, and comprehensive integration tests.
- **Order Service**: Complete order management system with order processing, item management, user/product validation, comprehensive repository with partial updates, REST API handlers, and full integration test suite.
- **Database**: Shared PostgreSQL connection and migration logic using GORM with proper relationships between services.
- **Deployment**: Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for app, Postgres, and frontend with nginx reverse proxy.
- **Testing**: Complete unit and integration test suites for all services with CI/CD pipeline and coverage reporting.
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI YAML specifications for all three services with interactive Swagger UI.

## Next Steps
**Prioritize these to advance the project:**
- **Add Authentication (JWT) and Role-Based Access Control** to User Service.
- **Enhance Product Service**: Add inventory tracking, category management, and search functionality.
- **Payment Service**: Implement payment processing simulation.
- **Inter-Service Communication**: Enhance REST communication between services with proper error handling.
- **Caching Layer**: Integrate Redis for product information and order caching.
- **Rate Limiting**: Add middleware for API endpoints.
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Implement structured logging and basic metrics.
- **Frontend Integration**: Enhance React frontend to work with all three services.

## Stretch Goals
- Circuit breaker pattern for resilience.
- Message queue integration (e.g., RabbitMQ or Kafka) for async operations.
- Kubernetes deployment manifests.
- Advanced monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana.
- Service mesh integration with Istio.

## Completed Milestones ✅
