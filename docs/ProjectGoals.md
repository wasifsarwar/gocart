"# Project Goals for Gocart E-commerce Microservices API

## Overview
This project aims to build a microservice-based e-commerce API system using Go. The core components include Product Service, User Service, and Order Service. Key technical requirements involve microservice architecture, PostgreSQL database integration, Redis caching, Docker deployment, comprehensive testing, API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger, logging, monitoring, and rate limiting.

## Implemented Features
- **Product Service**: Full CRUD operations for products (list, create, get, update, delete) with GORM-based repository, HTTP handlers using Gorilla Mux, OpenAPI documentation, unit and integration tests.
- **User Service**: Basic CRUD operations for users (create, get, update, delete, list) with GORM repository and HTTP handlers.
- **Database**: Shared PostgreSQL connection and migration logic using GORM.
- **Deployment**: Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for app and Postgres.
- **Testing**: Unit and integration tests for Product Service; CI workflow in GitHub Actions with coverage.
- **API Docs**: OpenAPI YAML files for both services.

## Next Steps
**Prioritize these to advance the project:**
- **Implement Order Service**: Start with basic order processing, payment simulation, and history tracking. Mirror the structure of Product/User services.
- **Add Authentication (JWT) and Role-Based Access Control** to User Service.
- **Enhance Product Service**: Add inventory tracking, category management, and search functionality.
- **Inter-Service Communication**: Set up REST or gRPC for services to interact (e.g., User auth for Orders).
- **Caching Layer**: Integrate Redis for product information.
- **Rate Limiting**: Add middleware for API endpoints.
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Implement structured logging and basic metrics.
- **Tests for User Service**: Add unit and integration tests similar to Product Service.
- **Resolve Port Conflicts**: Ensure services run on different ports or use a gateway.

## Stretch Goals
- Circuit breaker pattern for resilience.
- Message queue integration (e.g., RabbitMQ or Kafka) for async operations.
- Basic CI/CD pipeline beyond the current GitHub Actions setup.
- Full Swagger UI integration for API docs.
