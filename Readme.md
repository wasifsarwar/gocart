E-commerce Microservice API
Project Overview
Build a microservice-based e-commerce API system with the following components:

Product Service

Product catalog management
Inventory tracking
Category management
Search functionality


User Service

Authentication (JWT implementation)
User management
Role-based access control


Order Service

Order processing
Payment integration simulation
Order history and tracking



Key Technical Requirements

Microservice Architecture: Implement separate services that communicate via REST or gRPC
Database Integration: Use PostgreSQL and implement proper migrations
Caching Layer: Implement Redis for caching product information
Docker Integration: Create Docker files and Docker Compose for easy deployment
Testing: Comprehensive unit and integration tests
Documentation: Well-documented API with Swagger
Logging & Monitoring: Implement structured logging and basic metrics
Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting for API endpoints

Stretch Goals

Circuit breaker pattern
Message queue integration (RabbitMQ or Kafka)
Basic CI/CD pipeline configuration
